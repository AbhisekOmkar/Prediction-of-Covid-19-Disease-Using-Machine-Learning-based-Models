# Prediction-of-Covid-19-Disease-Using-Machine-Learning-based-Models

## About this Project

#### The forecasting system of COVID-19 uses nine standard forecasting models, such as Holt's Linear Model, Holt's Winter Model, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVM Prediction, Moving Average Model (employing AUTO ARIMA), AR Model, ARIMA Model and SARIMA Model.

#### Each model shows the prediction results of confirmed cases, death cases and recovery rate.
